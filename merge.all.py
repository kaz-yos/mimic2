### Individual data file concatenater
## This Python3 script concatenates all the individual files of the same data type.
## It also removes duplicated headers.

## Import libraries
import os

## Specifiy folder to work on. This folder needs to have folders 00-32. The merged data is created here
os.chdir('/Users/kazuki/mimic2')

## Ask for the folder range
end_plus_one = input("Give the end of range (starts at 00; max 32; default 32): ")    # text
## If empty give 33 (full range)
if end_plus_one == "":
    end_plus_one = 33
## Otherwise add one
else:
    end_plus_one = int(end_plus_one)
    end_plus_one = end_plus_one + 1
## Define the folder number range
folders = range(0, end_plus_one)

## Create a named dictionary of variables
dict_of_tables = {1:'ADDITIVES-',
2:'ADMISSIONS-',
3:'A_CHARTDURATIONS-',
4:'A_IODURATIONS-',
5:'A_MEDDURATIONS-',
6:'CENSUSEVENTS-',
7:'CHARTEVENTS-',
8:'COMORBIDITY_SCORES-',
9:'DELIVERIES-',
10:'DEMOGRAPHICEVENTS-',
11:'DEMOGRAPHIC_DETAIL-',
12:'DRGEVENTS-',
13:'D_PATIENTS-',
14:'ICD9-',
15:'ICUSTAYEVENTS-',
16:'ICUSTAY_DAYS-',
17:'ICUSTAY_DETAIL-',
18:'IOEVENTS-',
19:'LABEVENTS-',
20:'MEDEVENTS-',
21:'MICROBIOLOGYEVENTS-',
22:'NOTEEVENTS-',
23:'POE_MED-',
24:'POE_ORDER-',
25:'PROCEDUREEVENTS-',
26:'TOTALBALEVENTS-'}
